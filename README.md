# Generate-Faces-Using-GAN

# Overview
Training a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) on a dataset of faces to train it to generate new images of faces that look as realistic as possible

# Defining the Model
A GAN is comprised of two adversarial networks, a discriminator and a generator.
